      I am a trainee software developer currently based in the North-West of England. After a successful career in the arts sector delivering on many prolific projects such as a world-class classical music festival and summer school, I have gradually been turning to a career in software development.</br></br>

      I have always had a natural aptitude for both music and maths, and I believe these traits are part of the reason that I have been able to quickly understand the patterns and syntax that make up coding languages. Alongside this, my turn towards software development has been aided by my 3+ years experience working in a software company servicing the arts sector. The team at Spektrix have encouraged me to learn to code on the job, and I have therefore been able to use my technical skills to drive success for the company's clients by delivering clever software solutions for everyday and bespoke issues.</br></br>
      
      I am now currently completing with my software development training via a full-time software development bootcamp with NorthCoders whilst on voluntary furlough from my current position. I keen to hear about part- or full-time work in the North-West as a software developer working with any language, and I'm available to chat any time!
