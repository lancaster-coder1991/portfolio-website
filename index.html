        I am a software developer currently based in the North-West of England. After a successful career in the arts sector delivering on many prolific projects such as a world-class classical music festival and summer school, I have discovered a love for coding and have turned to a career in software development!</br></br>

        I have always had a natural aptitude for both music and maths, and I believe these traits are part of the reason that I have been able to quickly understand the patterns and syntax that make up coding languages. My turn towards software development has been aided by my 3+ years experience working in a software company servicing the arts sector. The team at Spektrix encouraged me to learn to code on the job, and I was therefore been able to use my technical skills to drive success for the company's clients by delivering clever software solutions for everyday and bespoke issues.</br></br>
        
        I have now completed a full-time software development bootcamp with the award winning NorthCoders, as well as building a portfolio of personal projects. I keen to hear about part- or full-time as a software developer working with any language, and I'm available to chat any time!</br></br>
